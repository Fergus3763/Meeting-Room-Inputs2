# FIXLOG

> Tracks fixes and changes made by each spoke. Keep entries small and link to PRs/commits.

## 2025-10-02
- **chore(docs):** create FIXLOG stub for Integration/Parsing Spoke #2  
  **Why:** Provide target for tabs fix, absolute fetch paths, Unmapped coverage, export workflow verification.  
  **Next expected entries:**  
  - fix(admin): tabs render (Rooms, AV, F&B, Calendar, Upsells)  
  - feat(admin): enforce absolute fetch paths for GitHub Pages  
  - feat(admin): Raw JSON “Unmapped” shows all unmapped fields  
  - chore(admin): export workflow verified (in-memory → Export JSON → paste to canonical + snapshot)
