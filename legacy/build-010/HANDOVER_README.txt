IMPORTANT — HOW TO USE THESE FILES

1) CODE (for Netlify):
   Upload 'AdminApp_HANDOVER_BASELINE.zip' to Netlify (Deploys → Upload a deploy). Do NOT unzip.
   Inside are ONLY:
     - index.html  (the admin app)
     - _redirects  (SPA fallback)

2) YOUR DATA:
   - In the live app, click 'Import JSON' and choose YOUR last export (venue-admin-export.json).
   - If you don't have one, use 'baseline_example.json' just to test, then replace with your real data later.

3) CLEANED JSON:
   - Upload YOUR real Export JSON in this chat and I'll return a cleaned version immediately (no placeholders).

4) NEW CHAT:
   - Share your Netlify URL and attach this README plus 'baseline_example.json' if needed.
   - Ask the assistant to START WITH: 'Rooms UX — Description + Features (with Add custom) — single-file patch.'
